# 🧠 Smart FIR Automation System

**AI-powered, end-to-end digital FIR generation and verification system**

---

## 🏛️ Overview

**Smart FIR Automation System** is a multilingual, AI-integrated platform designed to automate the process of filing, verifying, and distributing **First Information Reports (FIRs)** digitally.

Built using **n8n**, **Google Sheets**, **Telegram Bot API**, and **AI agents**, this system bridges the gap between citizens and law enforcement through automation, natural language processing, and real-time reporting.

It eliminates manual form-filling, reduces reporting delays, and ensures every FIR is **legally formatted, timestamped, and tamper-proof**.

Would you like me to create the **Dashboard README section** (for police web interface) next — with live Google Sheets data fetching and search/verify features layout?
It would extend this documentation for your frontend development phase.
